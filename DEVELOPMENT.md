# Development Notes

## Current Project Status

We have implemented a Python project for a deep research pipeline with:

- A main module `deep_research.step1` that uses the OpenAI Agents SDK to generate research plans
- A comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
- Project structure following best practices

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-mock pytest-asyncio

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=deep_research
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run and verify tests**
   - Ensure all tests pass with the current implementation
   - Fix any issues found during testing

2. **Implement additional functionality**
   - Consider implementing Step 2 of the research pipeline (Execution layer)
   - Add a Step 3 for summarization and synthesis

3. **Improve error handling**
   - Add more robust error handling for API failures
   - Implement retries for transient errors

4. **Add observability**
   - Implement logging throughout the codebase
   - Add metrics collection for performance monitoring

5. **CI/CD setup**
   - Set up GitHub Actions or another CI system to run tests automatically
   - Implement automatic versioning and releases

## Code Quality

- Use `black` for code formatting
- Use `flake8` for linting
- Use `mypy` for type checking

## Documentation

- Add more docstrings to functions and classes
- Generate API documentation using Sphinx
