# Fact Check: Tracking Prompts, Results, and Costs in OpenAI Agents SDK: Best Practices and Considerations

## Overall Assessment

The report accurately synthesizes typical best practices and considerations for tracking prompts, results, and costs in the OpenAI Agents SDK. Most claims are general and presented as summaries of community practices, but some broad statements are not directly tied to specific sources. The report acknowledges existing disagreements (such as on granularity/performance and centralization) rather than asserting a single perspective, appropriately flagging points of conflict. No specific misleading or clearly false claims were found, but readers should note where assertions are based on general observation rather than detailed, sourced evidence. Overall, the report is factually solid but would benefit from more direct links between claims and referenced sources, especially for generalizations about community practice.

## Unsupported Claims

- No specific quantitative claims (such as exact performance impact, adoption rates, or cost figures) are present that would require direct sourcing, but some broad statements like 'most projects utilize SDK-provided hooks' and 'third-party observability and analytics tools are increasingly integrated' are not tied to specific sources or metrics, making these qualitative generalizations unsupported by precise external data in this report.
- The assertion that 'there is debate over using centralized dashboards versus decentralized, per-agent logging' is described qualitatively without direct citations of sources or concrete disagreements from the referenced materials.

## Conflicting Claims

- The report notes a thematic disagreement on 'granularity vs. performance,' with 'some sources advocate for selective logging, while others recommend comprehensive auditing.' This conflict is documented as part of Theme 3, but no specific conflicting numerical or factual claims are presented, only that disagreements exist in the community.
