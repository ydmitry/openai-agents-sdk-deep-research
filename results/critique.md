# Fact Check: Re-Creating a ChatGPT Deep Research Tool: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overall Assessment

Most of the claims in the report are well-supported by the provided sources, particularly with regard to the Transformer architecture, large-scale pretraining, RLHF/fine-tuning, data requirements, infrastructure, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Some sections—especially those about custom prompt engineering and privacy/security best practices—are not substantiated by the cited technical sources. However, these likely reflect general best practices extrapolated for the intended audience. The report presents a factually accurate synthesis overall, with minor overextensions.

## Unsupported Claims

- Customizing prompt engineering for research workflows: None of the listed sources specifically discuss custom prompt engineering for research workflows; this appears to be an extrapolation.
- Ensuring privacy and security in handling sensitive data: No explicit technical detail or support for this claim found in the cited sources.
