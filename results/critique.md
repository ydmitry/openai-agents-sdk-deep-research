# Fact Check: Re-creating a ChatGPT-like Deep Research Tool: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overall Assessment

The report provides general, reasonable best practices for building a ChatGPT-like research tool, but every substantive claim is unsupported as there are no source document summaries provided for verification. The report lacks proper source references and offers assertions without substantiation. Without sources, the factual accuracy of architecture, process, and ethical recommendations cannot be confirmed.

## Unsupported Claims

- All technical recommendations (e.g., on transformer architectures, retrieval-augmented generation, critique/bias modules, UX design, privacy/security measures) are presented without direct source support or citation.
- The statement that 'ChatGPT is renowned for its deep research ability' is unsupported within the report or supplied summaries.
